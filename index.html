            <h1>Optimal Tank Conditions:</h1>
                <h3>Clean Tank:</h3>
                    <p>No matter what kind of filter media you choose, it should allow water to flow freely and not get plugged from lots of debris. You never want to replace all your filter media at the same time, or you will lose the beneficial bacteria that make up the biological filter. You can rinse and reuse most filter media, unless it is falling apart. After you have collected your waste water from your water change, use that water to rinse your filtration media. Never rinse your filter media in freshwater, or you may lose the beneficial bacteria it contains. Once you have removed the larger debris, be sure to wipe out the filter container and replace the media. It will not look or smell clean–that’s the point! You want to keep your biological filtration bacteria in their place.</p>
                <h3>Correct salinity:</h3>
                    <p>Checking Salinity/Topping Off: Daily
                        Heated saltwater aquariums, even with a tight-fitting lid, will lose water to evaporation. When this happens, you will notice the aquarium water salinity increases. This is because when the water leaves your tank, the salt stays behind, becoming more concentrated. To correct this, you will need to add heated FRESHWATER on a regular basis. It will feel very odd at first, but this will keep your salinity stable. Make sure your salinity stays in the correct range using a hydrometer or refractometer.</p>
                <h3>Correct Temperature:</h3>
                        <p>The only water parameter you must always test daily is temperature. Do not rely on sticky, external thermometers. Invest a few dollars in a submerged thermometer or a few more for a digital one. Check it daily to make sure your heaters are functioning correctly. Tropical saltwater fish are not happy when cold and will easily sicken and die.</p>
